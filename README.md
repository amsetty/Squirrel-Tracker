# Squirrel-Tracker 

## Project Description

Using the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census Data, Squirrel Tracker maintains a database of all squirrel sightings with functionality to update existing sightings as well as add new sightings. Our Squirrel Tracker also has a map display of Central Park that displays sightings, as well as a statistics page that shows a snapshot of the accumulated squirrel sighting data. Addtionally, we have incorporated management commands to import and export the databases using path argument.
